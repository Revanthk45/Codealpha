# Hangman Game

## About the Project
This is a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

## Features
- A selection of challenging words.
- Traditional Hangman rules (6 incorrect guesses allowed).
- Displays guessed letters and remaining attempts.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Simple and user-friendly text interface.

## How to Play
1. Run the script, and the game will randomly choose a secret word.
2. The number of letters in the word will be displayed as underscores (_ _ _).
3. Enter one letter per turn to guess the word.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position.
5. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a life.
6. You win by guessing all the letters before running out of lives.
7. If you lose all 6 lives, the game ends, and the correct word is revealed.
